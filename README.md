<h1>Scala-Js Games</h1>
<p>
    This is a collection of games ported from Java to Scala-Js: the
    <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala-js-games/blob/master/src/main/scala/example/Asteroids.scala">
    source</a> for each game is written in Scala, and <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~doeraene/scala-js/">
    cross compiled</a> to run in the browser targeting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas">
    HTML5 Canvas</a>. The original games can be found <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/Java-Games/blob/master/GameLibrary/GameLibrary.java">
    here</a> and targeting Java/Swing. Although this is basically a
    complete rewrite, the user-facing side of the game should be exactly
    the same.
</p>

<p>
    The games are, in order:

<ul>
    <li><b>Asteroids</b>: shoot down the asteroid swarms and avoid getting hit!</li>
    <li><b>Astrolander</b>: bring your lander to a a gentle landing on flat ground before you run out of fuel.</li>
    <li><b>Snake</b>: eat apples to grow long and don't crash into walls!</li>
    <li><b>Pong</b>: outsmart your AI opponent to get the ball past his paddle (right) to score points!</li>
    <li><b>Brick</b>: use your paddle to bounce the ball up, destroying all the bricks before you run out of balls.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The controls are generally up-down-left-right and spacebar; they
    aren't very complex games. Click on a game to start playing and click
    somewhere else to pause it.
